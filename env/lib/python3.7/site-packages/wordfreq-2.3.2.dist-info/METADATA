wordfreq is a Python library for looking up the frequencies of words in many
languages, based on many sources of data.

Author: Robyn Speer


## Installation

wordfreq requires Python 3 and depends on a few other Python modules
(msgpack, langcodes, and regex). You can install it and its dependencies
in the usual way, either by getting it from pip:

    pip3 install wordfreq

or by getting the repository and running its setup.py:

    python3 setup.py install

See [Additional CJK installation](#additional-cjk-installation) for extra
steps that are necessary to get Chinese, Japanese, and Korean word frequencies.


## Usage

wordfreq provides access to estimates of the frequency with which a word is
used, in 36 languages (see *Supported languages* below). It uses many different
data sources, not just one corpus.

It provides both 'small' and 'large' wordlists:

- The 'small' lists take up very little memory and cover words that appear at
  least once per million words.
- The 'large' lists cover words that appear at least once per 100 million
  words.

The default list is 'best', which uses 'large' if it's available for the
language, and 'small' otherwise.

The most straightforward function for looking up frequencies is:

    word_frequency(word, lang, wordlist='best', minimum=0.0)

This function looks up a word's frequency in the given language, returning its
frequency as a decimal between 0 and 1.

    >>> from wordfreq import word_frequency
    >>> word_frequency('cafe', 'en')
    1.07e-05

    >>> word_frequency('café', 'en')
    5.75e-06

    >>> word_frequency('cafe', 'fr')
    1.51e-06

    >>> word_frequency('café', 'fr')
    5.13e-05


`zipf_frequency` is a variation on `word_frequency` that aims to return the
word frequency on a human-friendly logarithmic scale. The Zipf scale was
proposed by Marc Brysbaert, who created the SUBTLEX lists. The Zipf frequency
of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it appears per
billion words. A word with Zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words, for
example, and a word with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words.

Reasonable Zipf values are between 0 and 8, but because of the cutoffs
described above, the minimum Zipf value appearing in these lists is 1.0 for the
'large' wordlists and 3.0 for 'small'. We use 0 as the default Zipf value
for words that do not appear in the given wordlist, although it should mean
one occurrence per billion words.

    >>> from wordfreq import zipf_frequency
    >>> zipf_frequency('the', 'en')
    7.77

    >>> zipf_frequency('word', 'en')
    5.29

    >>> zipf_frequency('frequency', 'en')
    4.43

    >>> zipf_frequency('zipf', 'en')
    1.57

    >>> zipf_frequency('zipf', 'en', wordlist='small')
    0.0


The parameters to `word_frequency` and `zipf_frequency` are:

- `word`: a Unicode string containing the word to look up. Ideally the word
  is a single token according to our tokenizer, but if not, there is still
  hope -- see *Tokenization* below.

- `lang`: the BCP 47 or ISO 639 code of the language to use, such as 'en'.

- `wordlist`: which set of word frequencies to use. Current options are
  'small', 'large', and 'best'.

- `minimum`: If the word is not in the list or has a frequency lower than
  `minimum`, return `minimum` instead. You may want to set this to the minimum
  value contained in the wordlist, to avoid a discontinuity where the wordlist
  ends.


## Frequency bins

wordfreq's wordlists are designed to load quickly and take up little space in
the repository.  We accomplish this by avoiding meaningless precision and
packing the words into frequency bins.

In wordfreq, all words that have the same Zipf frequency rounded to the nearest
hundredth have the same frequency. We don't store any more precision than that.
So instead of having to store that the frequency of a word is
.000011748975549395302, where most of those digits are meaningless, we just store
the frequency bins and the words they contain.

Because the Zipf scale is a logarithmic scale, this preserves the same relative
precision no matter how far down you are in the word list. The frequency of any
word is precise to within 1%.

(This is not a claim about _accuracy_, but about _precision_. We believe that
the way we use multiple data sources and discard outliers makes wordfreq a
more accurate measurement of the way these words are really used in written
language, but it's unclear how one would measure this accuracy.)


## The figure-skating metric

We combine word frequencies from different sources in a way that's designed
to minimize the impact of outliers. The method reminds me of the scoring system
in Olympic figure skating:

- Find the frequency of each word according to each data source.
- For each word, drop the sources that give it the highest and lowest frequency.
- Average the remaining frequencies.
- Rescale the resulting frequency list to add up to 1.


## Sources and supported languages

This data comes from a Luminoso project called [Exquisite Corpus][xc], whose
goal is to download good, varied, multilingual corpus data, process it
appropriately, and combine it into unified resources such as wordfreq.

[xc]: https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/exquisite-corpus

Exquisite Corpus compiles 8 different domains of text, some of which themselves
come from multiple sources:

- **Wikipedia**, representing encyclopedic text
- **Subtitles**, from OPUS OpenSubtitles 2018 and SUBTLEX
- **News**, from NewsCrawl 2014 and GlobalVoices
- **Books**, from Google Books Ngrams 2012
- **Web** text, from ParaCrawl, the Leeds Internet Corpus, and the MOKK
  Hungarian Webcorpus
- **Twitter**, representing short-form social media
- **Reddit**, representing potentially longer Internet comments
- **Miscellaneous** word frequencies: in Chinese, we import a free wordlist
  that comes with the Jieba word segmenter, whose provenance we don't really
  know

The following languages are supported, with reasonable tokenization and at
least 3 different sources of word frequencies:

[1] Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian use the same underlying word list, because
they share most of their vocabulary and grammar, they were once considered the
same language, and language detection cannot distinguish them. This word list
can also be accessed with the language code `sh`.

[2] The Norwegian text we have is specifically written in Norwegian Bokmål, so
we give it the language code 'nb' instead of the vaguer code 'no'. We would use
'nn' for Nynorsk, but there isn't enough data to include it in wordfreq.

[3] This data represents text written in both Simplified and Traditional
Chinese, with primarily Mandarin Chinese vocabulary. See "Multi-script
languages" below.

Some languages provide 'large' wordlists, including words with a Zipf frequency
between 1.0 and 3.0. These are available in 14 languages that are covered by
enough data sources.


## Other functions

`tokenize(text, lang)` splits text in the given language into words, in the same
way that the words in wordfreq's data were counted in the first place. See
*Tokenization*.

`top_n_list(lang, n, wordlist='best')` returns the most common *n* words in
the list, in descending frequency order.

    >>> from wordfreq import top_n_list
    >>> top_n_list('en', 10)
    ['the', 'of', 'to', 'and', 'a', 'in', 'i', 'is', 'that', 'for']

    >>> top_n_list('es', 10)
    ['de', 'la', 'que', 'el', 'en', 'y', 'a', 'los', 'no', 'se']

`iter_wordlist(lang, wordlist='best')` iterates through all the words in a
wordlist, in descending frequency order.

`get_frequency_dict(lang, wordlist='best')` returns all the frequencies in
a wordlist as a dictionary, for cases where you'll want to look up a lot of
words and don't need the wrapper that `word_frequency` provides.

`available_languages(wordlist='best')` returns a dictionary whose keys are
language codes, and whose values are the data file that will be loaded to
provide the requested wordlist in each language.

`get_language_info(lang)` returns a dictionary of information about how we
preprocess text in this language, such as what script we expect it to be
written in, which characters we normalize together, and how we tokenize it.
See its docstring for more information.

`random_words(lang='en', wordlist='best', nwords=5, bits_per_word=12)`
returns a selection of random words, separated by spaces. `bits_per_word=n`
will select each random word from 2^n words.

If you happen to want an easy way to get [a memorable, xkcd-style
password][xkcd936] with 60 bits of entropy, this function will almost do the
job. In this case, you should actually run the similar function
`random_ascii_words`, limiting the selection to words that can be typed in
ASCII. But maybe you should just use [xkpa][].

## Tokenization

wordfreq uses the Python package `regex`, which is a more advanced
implementation of regular expressions than the standard library, to
separate text into tokens that can be counted consistently. `regex`
produces tokens that follow the recommendations in [Unicode
Annex #29, Text Segmentation][uax29], including the optional rule that
splits words between apostrophes and vowels.

There are exceptions where we change the tokenization to work better
with certain languages:

- In Arabic and Hebrew, it additionally normalizes ligatures and removes
  combining marks.

- In Japanese and Korean, instead of using the regex library, it uses the
  external library `mecab-python3`. This is an optional dependency of wordfreq,
  and compiling it requires the `libmecab-dev` system package to be installed.

- In Chinese, it uses the external Python library `jieba`, another optional
  dependency.

- While the @ sign is usually considered a symbol and not part of a word,
  wordfreq will allow a word to end with "@" or "@s". This is one way of
  writing gender-neutral words in Spanish and Portuguese.

[uax29]: http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/

When wordfreq's frequency lists are built in the first place, the words are
tokenized according to this function.

    >>> from wordfreq import tokenize
    >>> tokenize('l@s niñ@s', 'es')
    ['l@s', 'niñ@s']
    >>> zipf_frequency('l@s', 'es')
    2.8

Because tokenization in the real world is far from consistent, wordfreq will
also try to deal gracefully when you query it with texts that actually break
into multiple tokens:

    >>> zipf_frequency('New York', 'en')
    5.28
    >>> zipf_frequency('北京地铁', 'zh')  # "Beijing Subway"
    3.61

The word frequencies are combined with the half-harmonic-mean function in order
to provide an estimate of what their combined frequency would be. In Chinese,
where the word breaks must be inferred from the frequency of the resulting
words, there is also a penalty to the word frequency for each word break that
must be inferred.

This method of combining word frequencies implicitly assumes that you're asking
about words that frequently appear together. It's not multiplying the
frequencies, because that would assume they are statistically unrelated. So if
you give it an uncommon combination of tokens, it will hugely over-estimate
their frequency:

    >>> zipf_frequency('owl-flavored', 'en')
    3.2


## Multi-script languages

Two of the languages we support, Serbian and Chinese, are written in multiple
scripts. To avoid spurious differences in word frequencies, we automatically
transliterate the characters in these languages when looking up their words.

Serbian text written in Cyrillic letters is automatically converted to Latin
letters, using standard Serbian transliteration, when the requested language is
`sr` or `sh`. If you request the word list as `hr` (Croatian) or `bs`
(Bosnian), no transliteration will occur.

Chinese text is converted internally to a representation we call
"Oversimplified Chinese", where all Traditional Chinese characters are replaced
with their Simplified Chinese equivalent, *even if* they would not be written
that way in context. This representation lets us use a straightforward mapping
that matches both Traditional and Simplified words, unifying their frequencies
when appropriate, and does not appear to create clashes between unrelated words.

Enumerating the Chinese wordlist will produce some unfamiliar words, because
people don't actually write in Oversimplified Chinese, and because in
practice Traditional and Simplified Chinese also have different word usage.


## Similar, overlapping, and varying languages

As much as we would like to give each language its own distinct code and its
own distinct word list with distinct source data, there aren't actually sharp
boundaries between languages.

Sometimes, it's convenient to pretend that the boundaries between
languages coincide with national borders, following the maxim that "a language
is a dialect with an army and a navy" (Max Weinreich). This gets complicated
when the linguistic situation and the political situation diverge.
Moreover, some of our data sources rely on language detection, which of course
has no idea which country the writer of the text belongs to.

So we've had to make some arbitrary decisions about how to represent the
fuzzier language boundaries, such as those within Chinese, Malay, and
Croatian/Bosnian/Serbian.  See [Language Log][] for some firsthand reports of
the mutual intelligibility or unintelligibility of languages.

[Language Log]: http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=12633

Smoothing over our arbitrary decisions is the fact that we use the `langcodes`
module to find the best match for a language code. If you ask for word
frequencies in `cmn-Hans` (the fully specific language code for Mandarin in
Simplified Chinese), you will get the `zh` wordlist, for example.


## Additional CJK installation

Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have additional external dependencies so that
they can be tokenized correctly. Here we'll explain how to set them up,
in increasing order of difficulty.


### Chinese

To be able to look up word frequencies in Chinese, you need Jieba, a
pure-Python Chinese tokenizer:

    pip3 install jieba


### Japanese

We use MeCab, by Taku Kudo, to tokenize Japanese. To use this in wordfreq, three
things need to be installed:

  * The MeCab development library (called `libmecab-dev` on Ubuntu)
  * The UTF-8 version of the `ipadic` Japanese dictionary
    (called `mecab-ipadic-utf8` on Ubuntu)
  * The `mecab-python3` Python interface

To install these three things on Ubuntu, you can run:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libmecab-dev mecab-ipadic-utf8
pip3 install mecab-python3
```

If you choose to install `ipadic` from somewhere else or from its source code,
be sure it's configured to use UTF-8. By default it will use EUC-JP, which will
give you nonsense results.


### Korean

Korean also uses MeCab, with a Korean dictionary package by Yongwoon Lee and
Yungho Yu. This dictionary is not available as an Ubuntu package.

Here's a process you can use to install the Korean dictionary and the other
MeCab dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libmecab-dev mecab-utils
pip3 install mecab-python3
wget https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko-dic/downloads/mecab-ko-dic-2.0.1-20150920.tar.gz
tar xvf mecab-ko-dic-2.0.1-20150920.tar.gz
cd mecab-ko-dic-2.0.1-20150920
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

If wordfreq cannot find the Japanese or Korean data for MeCab when asked to
tokenize those languages, it will raise an error and show you the list of
paths it searched.

Sorry that this is difficult. We tried to just package the data files we need
with wordfreq, like we do for Chinese, but PyPI would reject the package for
being too large.
