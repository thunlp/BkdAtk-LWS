class TrackingStoreRegistry(StoreRegistry):
    """Scheme-based registry for tracking store implementations

    This class allows the registration of a function or class to provide an
    implementation for a given scheme of `store_uri` through the `register`
    methods. Implementations declared though the entrypoints
    `mlflow.tracking_store` group can be automatically registered through the
    `register_entrypoints` method.

    When instantiating a store through the `get_store` method, the scheme of
    the store URI provided (or inferred from environment) will be used to
    select which implementation to instantiate, which will be called with same
    arguments passed to the `get_store` method.
