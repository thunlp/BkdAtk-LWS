This module contains the base interface implemented by MLflow model deployment plugins.
In particular, a valid deployment plugin module must implement:

1. Exactly one client class subclassed from :py:class:`BaseDeploymentClient`, exposing the primary
   user-facing APIs used to manage deployments.
2. :py:func:`run_local`, for testing deployment by deploying a model locally
3. :py:func:`target_help`, which returns a help message describing target-specific URI format
   and deployment config
